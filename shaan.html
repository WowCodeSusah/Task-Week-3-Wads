          <p>Welcome to my world! I'm Shaan Kishore Gunwani, a 20-year-old student with a deep passion for both technology and the arts. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science at BINUS University International, where I'm diving into the exciting world of coding, algorithms, and software development.
            But that's not all; I'm also nurturing my artistic side by pursuing a Bachelor's in Tabla, a traditional Indian percussion instrument, from Akhil Bhartiya Ghandharva Mahavidyalaya in Mumbai, India. Music has been a part of my life since the tender age of 3, and playing the tabla has been a source of joy and expression for me ever since.
            <br><br>
            Balancing the complexities of computer science with the rhythmic melodies of tabla has been an enriching journey, allowing me to explore the intersections between technology and tradition, innovation and culture.
            <br><br>
            Beyond my academic pursuits, you'll often find me lost in the rhythms of tabla, experimenting with new beats, and exploring the vast landscape of music. Whether it's coding or composing, I'm always seeking new avenues for creativity and self-expression.
            <br><br>
            Join me on this journey as I continue to harmonize the worlds of technology and the arts, one keystroke and one beat at a time.</p>

            <h3>Quiz Game Project</h3>
            <p>During the culmination of my semester 3 Object-Oriented Programming course at BINUS University International, I embarked on an ambitious endeavor: the creation of a Quiz Game Project using the Java programming language. This project served as a culmination of my theoretical knowledge and practical skills in Java programming, as well as my understanding of object-oriented principles.</p>
            The Quiz Game Project aimed to provide an engaging and interactive platform for users to test their knowledge across various subjects. Leveraging Java's robust object-oriented features, I meticulously designed the architecture of the application, implementing classes for questions, answers, scoring mechanisms, and user interactions. One of the key highlights of this project was the incorporation of dynamic question generation, ensuring a diverse and challenging experience for users with each session. Through the use of data structures and algorithms, I developed algorithms to randomize question selection and maintain a fair distribution of difficulty levels. Furthermore, I prioritized user experience by implementing intuitive interfaces and responsive feedback mechanisms. The project also showcased my proficiency in handling exceptions, input validation, and file I/O operations, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the application. Throughout the development process, I embraced iterative refinement, soliciting feedback from peers and instructors to enhance functionality and address potential issues. This collaborative approach not only fostered a sense of teamwork but also instilled in me the importance of continuous improvement and adaptability. In conclusion, the Quiz Game Project stands as a testament to my passion for programming, my proficiency in Java development, and my commitment to delivering high-quality, innovative solutions. It serves as a compelling showcase of my abilities and aspirations in the realm of software engineering.</p>

            <h3>HTML, CSS, and Javascript Project</h3>
            <p>Upon completing my first semester at BINUS University International, I collaborated with a group of peers to undertake a comprehensive project that showcased our proficiency in web development technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was a culmination of our foundational knowledge acquired throughout the semester and provided an opportunity to apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios.</p>
  
  <p>Our objective was to design and develop a dynamic and visually appealing website that not only demonstrated our technical skills but also conveyed meaningful content to its audience. Leveraging HTML, we crafted the structural foundation of the website, ensuring semantic markup and accessibility standards were adhered to.</p>
  
  <p>With CSS, we brought our design vision to life, meticulously styling elements, defining layouts, and incorporating responsive design principles to ensure optimal viewing experiences across devices of varying screen sizes. This phase of the project allowed us to showcase our creativity and attention to detail, as we carefully crafted color schemes, typography choices, and visual elements to enhance the website's aesthetics.</p>
  
  <p>JavaScript served as the backbone of our project, enabling dynamic interactions and functionality that elevated the user experience. We implemented interactive features such as form validation, animated transitions, and dynamic content updates to engage visitors and create a seamless browsing experience.</p>
  
  <p>Throughout the development process, effective collaboration and communication were paramount. We divided tasks amongst team members, utilizing version control systems to manage code integration and ensure smooth workflow coordination. Regular meetings and feedback sessions facilitated iterative refinement, allowing us to address challenges, implement enhancements, and meet project milestones effectively.</p>
